### About The Project
This project is a senior design project at [Maquette University](https://www.marquette.edu/data-science/) that is centered around the data science lifecycle, from scraping data, to cleaning/wrangling data, to analysing data and all the steps in between this project helps Marquette Data Science Seniors be prepared for life after acadmeia. In this project we began by first scraping data from the [Milwaukee Police Department Call Logs](https://itmdapps.milwaukee.gov/MPDCallData/) in [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) before cleaning the data and exporting it into our [Oracle Autonomous Database](https://www.oracle.com/autonomous-database/). We then began to perform simple exploratory data analysis and paired our call data with other data sets surrounding milwaukee such as our Historical Real Estate Dataset which was first gathered from the [Milwaukee Tax Acessors portal](https://data.milwaukee.gov/dataset/property-sales-data) and later [cleaned](https://github.com/ecarrasco07/CrimeReportDS/blob/main/data_cleaning/Cleaning%20Data.ipynb) and imported into the Database.
